      <p>The true origin of Johnies hatred actually comes from his mother. It happened one fateful day in Febuary, after Johnies father got a job at the local chocolate factory. Johny's mother LOVED chocolate and would eat everything her husband would bring
        home. It only took 3 months for her to get diabetes and another 2 for her to lose both of her feet to it... </p>

    <div class="P5">
      <p>From that point on, Johnas had to carry his mother up the stairs every night, and down the stairs every morning. He never forgave his mother for all the chocolate, and thus the fruedian stair phobia was instilled. </p>

      <p>Here's the thing about stairs, they're tough to walk up. Trying to carry someone else up stairs is even harder.</p>

      <p>Johanus and his mother grew very close over the years. Johan would carry her down the stairs in the morning, she would make him breakfast, and they would sit and watch the sun rise and fall until Johan would carry her up the stairs to go to bed. It was a nice life. </p>
